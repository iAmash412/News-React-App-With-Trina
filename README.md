Our React App showing popular quotes from poems such as Jabberwocky- a refactoring exercise created by @getfutureproof.
## Refactor component structure
  - [x] create 'components', 'pages' and 'layout' folders with index.js files - what is meant to go in pages?
  - [x] move FaveButton and its tests to own folder in 'components'

  - [ ] create a `News` component in 'pages' folder which has local state and renders:
  - [x] A `Greeting` component which has local state
  - [ ] A `ReaderCount` component which has local state -created
  - [ ] A `FeaturedArticle` component that receives `chosenArticle` as a prop -created
  - [ ] A `Headlines` component that receives `articles` and `handleArticleSelect` as props - created

- [ ] adjust App to render only `Header`, `News` and `Footer`
